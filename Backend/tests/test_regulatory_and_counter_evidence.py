test_question = """A Tier-1 Indian telecom operator detects abnormal behaviour in a production 5G network slice supporting emergency communications.

At 02:17 UTC, the slice begins communicating with an unfamiliar external management endpoint. Network telemetry shows intermittent isolation violations between the affected slice and a management-plane service.

At the same time:
- A recently updated network-function container has a valid vendor signature.
- Its SBOM contains no known CVE matching the observed behaviour.
- The vendor claims the release is compliant with applicable 3GPP security requirements.
- An internal security analyst discovers that one retrieved security guidance document contains a modified requirement that appears to weaken isolation controls.
- A second authoritative document appears to impose a stricter requirement.
- Logs indicate privileged credentials associated with the network-function deployment were used shortly before the anomaly.

The operator cannot yet determine whether this is:
1. compromised network function,
2. credential compromise,
3. malicious configuration,
4. supply-chain compromise,
5. false positive/interoperability problem.

Assess the incident from technical, regulatory, evidentiary and governance perspectives for an Indian telecom operator.

Determine what is established, what remains unproven, whether the incident should be treated as a potentially serious security event, what evidence is required before attribution, what regulatory obligations may be relevant, and whether automated operational action is appropriate."""
